                To me, the biggest benefit of Knowledge Based Games is when you
                apply a similar approach to life, embracing exploration,
                perseverance, curiosity and a cultivation of skill, connecting
                the dots yourself, and so on. Then practising in your everyday
                life, feeds back into your gaming experience. That's just one of
                the many things I love about gaming.
